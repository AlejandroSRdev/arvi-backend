    "assistantContext": "My name is Alex. I work as a software developer focused on backend systems and distributed services. I enjoy building reliable systems, reading about software architecture, and maintaining a disciplined but sustainable routine. Lately I feel mentally scattered due to context switching and want to regain consistency and focus in my daily work.",
    "testData": {
      "What habit, routine or area of your life would you like to improve or strengthen right now?": "I want to establish a structured deep work routine during my mornings. Right now my attention is constantly fragmented by meetings and Slack notifications.",
      "Why is it important for you to work on this habit? What do you hope to achieve in the long term?": "I believe focused work time will significantly improve the quality of the systems I build. In the long term, I want to feel proud of my output and experience less end-of-day frustration.",
      "Have you already tried to build or maintain this habit before? What helped you or what failed?": "I attempted time blocking last quarter and it worked briefly when I protected my calendar. It broke down when I allowed meetings to override my focus blocks without rescheduling them.",
      "How would you like to approach the process of integrating this habit into your daily life?": "I want to start with one protected hour in the morning and gradually extend it. Keeping it visible on my calendar and communicating it to my team should help.",
      "Which approach suits you best: progressive and smooth, or demanding and disciplined from the start?": "Progressive works better for me because sudden strict rules tend to create friction. I prefer building momentum slowly so the habit feels natural over time.",
      "Do you have any environment, person or place that helps you stay consistent?": "My home office in the early morning, before the rest of the household wakes up, is where I feel most focused. Noise-canceling headphones are also a significant help.",
      "What thought or emotion usually makes you give up when trying to maintain a habit?": "When I feel like I am already behind on other tasks, I tend to sacrifice focus time to catch up. That reactive mindset is my biggest obstacle."

    "testData": {
      "What habit, routine or area of your life would you like to improve or strengthen right now?": "I want to build a daily exercise habit, ideally running or cycling before starting my workday. Physical movement has a direct impact on my mental clarity.",
      "Why is it important for you to work on this habit? What do you hope to achieve in the long term?": "Exercise reduces my anxiety and helps me approach complex technical problems with more patience. Long term, I want sustainable energy levels and better physical health.",
      "Have you already tried to build or maintain this habit before? What helped you or what failed?": "Yes, I ran consistently for six weeks last year. It collapsed when a project deadline arrived and I told myself I would resume after, which never happened.",
      "How would you like to approach the process of integrating this habit into your daily life?": "I plan to lay out my running clothes the night before and commit to just 20 minutes to lower the activation barrier. Consistency matters more than duration at first.",
      "Which approach suits you best: progressive and smooth, or demanding and disciplined from the start?": "Progressive is better for me with physical habits because injury or burnout can kill momentum entirely. I want a sustainable pace from the beginning.",
      "Do you have any environment, person or place that helps you stay consistent?": "Running in my neighborhood park in the morning is pleasant and low-friction. Having a mapped route already decided removes any decision fatigue.",
      "What thought or emotion usually makes you give up when trying to maintain a habit?": "Fatigue after a difficult workday makes me rationalize skipping the next morning. One skip often becomes a week-long gap before I realize it."

      "What habit, routine or area of your life would you like to improve or strengthen right now?": "I want to dedicate consistent time each week to reading books on software architecture and distributed systems. My professional growth has slowed and I want to fix that.",
      "Why is it important for you to work on this habit? What do you hope to achieve in the long term?": "Staying current in my field makes me a better engineer and opens doors to more interesting projects. I want to feel intellectually stimulated and professionally competitive.",
      "Have you already tried to build or maintain this habit before? What helped you or what failed?": "I read consistently for about two months last winter. It broke when I stopped carrying my book around and lost the environmental trigger that reminded me to read.",
      "How would you like to approach the process of integrating this habit into your daily life?": "I want to attach reading to an existing habit, like having tea after dinner. Keeping the book visible on the table will serve as a consistent cue.",
      "Which approach suits you best: progressive and smooth, or demanding and disciplined from the start?": "Smooth and gradual, starting with just 15 minutes per session. I find that imposing a large reading quota makes it feel like homework and kills my enjoyment.",
      "Do you have any environment, person or place that helps you stay consistent?": "Reading in the living room after dinner, away from my work desk, creates a clear mental separation between work and learning time.",
      "What thought or emotion usually makes you give up when trying to maintain a habit?": "When the book becomes technically dense and slow to read, I feel impatient and switch to something easier. I need to push through those sections more deliberately."

      "What habit, routine or area of your life would you like to improve or strengthen right now?": "I want to establish a proper shutdown routine at the end of each workday. Right now I rarely fully disconnect, which leaves me mentally exhausted by the weekend.",
      "Why is it important for you to work on this habit? What do you hope to achieve in the long term?": "Clear boundaries between work and personal time are essential for long-term sustainability as a developer. I want to protect my creativity and avoid burnout over the coming years.",
      "Have you already tried to build or maintain this habit before? What helped you or what failed?": "I tried writing a daily end-of-day summary note, which worked for a few weeks. It failed when I started skipping it under pressure and never rebuilt the habit afterward.",
      "How would you like to approach the process of integrating this habit into your daily life?": "I want to create a two-minute shutdown checklist and trigger it by closing my IDE at the same time each day. Simple and repeatable rituals work best for me.",
      "Which approach suits you best: progressive and smooth, or demanding and disciplined from the start?": "I prefer a firm rule from day one on this habit since ambiguity is what caused previous failures. A clear stopping time removes the need for willpower.",
      "Do you have any environment, person or place that helps you stay consistent?": "My partner often signals that dinner is ready around 7pm, which serves as a natural external trigger to close my laptop and step away.",
      "What thought or emotion usually makes you give up when trying to maintain a habit?": "A sense of unfinished work makes me feel guilty about stopping. I need to reframe incomplete tasks as normal rather than as failures to avoid staying late."

    "testData": {
      "What habit, routine or area of your life would you like to improve or strengthen right now?": "I want to practice journaling for 10 minutes each morning to clarify my priorities before starting work. Mental clarity first thing in the day changes everything.",
      "Why is it important for you to work on this habit? What do you hope to achieve in the long term?": "Journaling helps me separate urgent from important tasks and reduces the anxiety of an undefined day. Over time, I want a clearer sense of progress in both work and life.",
      "Have you already tried to build or maintain this habit before? What helped you or what failed?": "I journaled briefly after reading a productivity book two years ago. It faded because I had no structured format and ended up staring at a blank page most mornings.",
      "How would you like to approach the process of integrating this habit into your daily life?": "Using a simple prompt-based template will remove the blank page problem that stopped me before. I plan to keep it short and non-pressured, three questions maximum.",
      "Which approach suits you best: progressive and smooth, or demanding and disciplined from the start?": "Progressive is better here because forcing deep reflection too early in the morning creates resistance. I want it to feel light and easy before making it more substantive.",
      "Do you have any environment, person or place that helps you stay consistent?": "Doing it while drinking my first coffee, before opening any screen, connects the habit to an already-established routine anchor.",
      "What thought or emotion usually makes you give up when trying to maintain a habit?": "If I miss one morning I feel like the streak is broken and lose motivation to continue. I need to normalize occasional misses without letting them end the habit entirely."
